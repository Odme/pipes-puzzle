# Pipes Puzzle 🧪
Evolution Home Challenge. Deployed in [Surge](http://odme-pipes-puzzle.surge.sh) 🛫.

## Technologies 🧑‍💻⛰️

### ThreeJS [Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/) - Why? 📊

- Easy to follow
- Great documentation
- Big community
- Tested and still in constant mantenance
- Declarative

### React API Context - Why? 💾

- Light
- Easy implementation
- Little Application

### Styled Components - Why? 💅

- Declarative styled components
- Maintain the same HTMLElement attributes
- Easy way to inject a thme
- Composed components looks cleaner


## Additional Tools

### Google Fonts

- Required to find a font with all pipes figures (Used font: [Sawarabi Mincho](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sawarabi+Mincho))

### [Facetype.js](https://gero3.github.io/facetype.js/)

- Required to transform the fonts and map a json with all pipes paths to create a geometry element with it


## Which are the parts of the code are most impressive to look at? 😃

- Provider delegation and distribution with Sockect Instance, Services, Data Management and Theming
- Data mapping
- Component Parting


## Which are the aspects of the code that you are not so proud of? And why is that? 😥

- ThreeJs usage `-` Idk if I'm using all related to the library in a correct way
- Socket Message parsing, probably I'm losing some messages and they aren't storaged in the state


## Level Passwords Obtained 🎮

- Still in progress

## Known Limitations ❗

- Probably the state management, with a higher WebGL resources and elements probably I need move my state management to a different library like Redux or MobX

## Key Design Decisions Made 🔑

- Readability, easy to follow and understand for everyone
- Light solution and easy to modify

## How to Launch the Solution 🚀
